# Third-party grammars

`cairo.tmLanguage.json` is the TextMate grammar used by the official Cairo VS Code extension.

- Licence: Apache License 2.0 (https://github.com/software-mansion/vscode-cairo/blob/main/LICENSE)
- Why it is here: the `cairo` grammar bundled with Shiki only covers Cairo 0 (`func`, `felt`, `tempvar`).
  The Cairo in my repos is Cairo 1/2 (`fn`, `mod`, `#[starknet::contract]`), which this grammar highlights correctly.
- Unmodified, except that `lib/highlight/shiki.server.ts` registers it under the name `cairo`.
